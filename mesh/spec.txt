task A (most risk): a local db of known meshites
     --tells those about its current state, on the mesh port
     --receives and persists such messages



task B :    meshite should open 2 ports on router
    meshPort: for receiving messages 
       --from other meshites at /meshite/*  
         --AND for app serving at /* minus the prev.
    ssh port: to allow me to get in.



    internal port numbers are mesh: 9091   ssh: 22
    preferred external numbers mesh: 9091  ssh: 22555
      --(find others and use them and publish them to other meshites
        --  if it works...and the meshites should help each other to test this.
    may need to try to open port 80 for clients in deadbrain school networks
