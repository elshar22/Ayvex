If you run:

netstat -ntl
on bserver you will see that the port 2210 is only listening on 127.0.0.1 IP address. To get it listen on interface connected to Internet we must enable GatewayPorts option in ssh server's config uration. By default GatewayPorts are disabled in sshd, but we can simply enable them:

vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
then add:

GatewayPorts clientspecified
save the file and restart sshd:

/etc/init.d/ssh restart
We could have just enable GatewayPorts by typing On instead of clientspecified, that would route any ssh tunnel to network interface. This way we can control which tunnel will be accessible f rom outside, and on which interface.
