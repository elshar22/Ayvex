short name I'll use for the project

almost everything will live in just a few text files.

"Dr Avyex Industries"  sounds like a bond villain or whatever

we'll think of something better later




the goal is to enable the level of editing you get in minecraft, but with meshes not blocks
the editing should work like "magic" or "nanotech", or "earthbending" or whathave you.
render distances shall be infinite.
there shall be an octree looking thingy (or voronoi cells in space formulation) ,
which shall have the forward propagation of compressed-information views. (snow globes)

platform: 3gl: inside browser for now until proven (msft ie11 will support supposedly)

can replace with other render etc later if the basic octree projection system works to save data.

ajax to get the meshes/norms/color/depthmap

must be available: explicit non-rendering... see *where* you are not seeing. see where you are getting "tricked" with lazy rendering!

sample-sample-sample (and presample) to keep framerate up.  trust random and trust consistent hashing.
