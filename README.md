At the intersection of business and gaming.

It will be a better world if VR is open, distributed, ubiquitous, and free. Virtual reality can improve on regular reality in many ways. People will migrate to cyberspace, very much as sciFi has portrayed.  We are paving the way, to insure it's a little more pleasant, free, and open when you arrive.

- _Gamification by Design_</br>
- _Ready Player One_  <br>  (depicts the benefits of a single system VR, and what happens if it isn't open)</br>
