Ayvex
=====

short name I'll use for the project

almost everything will live in just a few text files.

"Dr Avyex Industries"  sounds like a bond villain or whatever

we'll think of something better later




the goal is to enable the level of editing you get in minecraft, but with meshes not blocks
the editing should work like "magic" or "nanotech", or "earthbending" or whathave you.
render distances shall be infinite.
there shall be an octree looking thingy (or voronoi cells in space formulation) ,
which shall have the forward propagation of compressed-information views. (snow globes)

platform: 3gl: inside browser for now until proven (msft ie11 will support supposedly)

can replace with other render etc later if the basic octree projection system works to save data.

ajax to get the meshes/norms/color/depthmap

explicit non-rendering... see *where* you are not seeing.

sample-sample-sample (and presample) to keep framerate up.  trust random and trust consistent hashing.




====financial plan.====
startup mid july
mid-aug, So far I've put in ...  (in case it's relevant for issuing shares or tax purposes)
-old computer $50
-new RAM $75
-SD cards, USB cards, $50
-about 50 hours @ $50/hr
-some fraction of internet connection: how about 50% of ____/month

--i do want to issue some type of less-formal "shares". 
--i want to issue them rather liberally as worth "nothing" but potentially worth something if we get big
--i do want people to be able to contribute time or money or ____ and get "paid" in shares.  But I want to be careful with valuations

In round numbers, I'll start with 4000 shares, give 500 each to scott and dad, 3000 to me.






other ideas: 
--a database+site where people can track/reconcile obligations, all in public so no issue with govt etc
--a database+site that lets people start company for even a trivial business venture.
(those two synergize)
