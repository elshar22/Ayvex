someday, all ayvex servers should have the wicd-curses app as part of their image.....SEE BOTTOM OF THIS FILE

Open terminal and edit /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf on the SD card (not on your machine).

Here’s how to open it with nano:

cd /path/to/your/sd/card/
sudo nano etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
and add the following to the bottom of the file:

network={
    ssid="your-network-ssid-name"
    psk="your-network-password"
}






SNIPPED FROM SOME WEB PAGE.....



edit /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf and add id_str="school" under the schools wpa info and id_str="home" under your homes wpa info. Your file should now look similar to this:

ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="SCHOOLS NETWORK NAME"
    psk="SCHOOLS PASSWORD"
    id_str="school"
}

network={
    ssid="HOME NETWORK NAME"
    psk="HOME PASSWORD"
    id_str="home"
}
Then set up /etc/network/interfaces with iface school inet static and iface home inet static in it so it looks like the following:

auto lo

iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet dhcp

allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet manual
wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

iface school inet static
address <school address>
gateway <school gateway>
netmask <school netmask>

iface home inet static
address <home address>
gateway <home gateway>
netmask <home netmask>

It might be worth noting: If I understand the documentation correctly, in order to use this approach, you must have and id_str property for EVERY network in your wpa_supplicant.conf file. Otherwise this won't work. Can you confirm? – PICyourBrain Mar 31 '14 at 20:29
  	 	
I don't believe this to be the case. – les Nov 21 '14 at 1:24

I recently stumbled across a console application that sorts all the wireless configuration hell out. You can also use this tool to configure the LAN interface.

sudo apt-get install wicd-curses
It will install quite a few other packages but ir uns its own daemon in the background. This manages the networks and makes sure you connect to the ones you want. Run it with

sudo wicd-curses
