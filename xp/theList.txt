This is an attempt to use gamification at a very deep level in the company.  
Lets people trade their free time for upside, without need to pay cash right now.

Each serial number below is a 'coupon' given for work on the project.  In physical space they might look like this...


//---------------------------------------------------------------------//
// 1 XP share
//
//
//  Certificate of Upside Participation in the Ayvex Corporation
//
//
//    1 XP : if we e*X*perience *P*rofit, so will you.
//
//    
//    cash redemption value 1 cent
//

Ayvex Corporation is an experimental corporation dedicated to democratizing the 3d gaming experience
and applying gaming technology outside the traditional gaming world (e.g. bringing gamelike UI to business
applications, scientific visualization, etc)

We don't think there is benefit in secret dealings, secret source code, etc etc.  It will all be on github.
We aren't allergic to money.  We intend to make a profit. Just not right away.  If/When we become profitable,
we want to share with everyone who helped.  This might be in the form of shares in an eventual  IPO, or 
extra kickstarter bonus (if we go that route), or cash dividend.  Things are still loose so this will be steve's 
call about the reward structure.  Worst case scenario you can trade these coupons in for the face redemption value.

These *are* intended to be negotiable:  See steve to transfer XP. It will be done via edits to this file in
the master branch of the Ayvex project.
