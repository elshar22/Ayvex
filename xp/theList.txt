Ayvex Corporation is an experimental corporation dedicated to democratizing the 3d gaming experience
and applying gaming technology outside the traditional gaming world (e.g. bringing gamelike UI to business
applications, scientific visualization, etc)

We don't think there is usually a benefit to secret dealings, secret source code, etc etc.  It will all be on github.
We aren't allergic to money.  We intend to make a profit. Just not right away.  If/When we become profitable,
we want to share with everyone who helped.  This might be in the form of shares in an eventual  IPO, or 
extra kickstarter bonus (if we go that route), or cash dividend.  Things are still loose so this will be steve's 
call about the reward structure.  Worst case scenario you can trade these coupons in for the face redemption value.

These *are* intended to be negotiable:  See steve to transfer XP. It will be done via edits to this file in
the master branch of the Ayvex project.  It has been suggested to build a market in similar "penny options" 
for startups...Trading them online, etc.  

The benefits of doing it this way: many startups fail, but this way the failure is effectively free.  Success leaves just enough information to straighten out money in a fair way.


---Ayvex Corporation is willing to trade XP+cash for expertise. see issues list on github.---
